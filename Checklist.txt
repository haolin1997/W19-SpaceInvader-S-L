BASE REQUIREMENTS (20% of final grade): These are the minimum requirements your game must have to get full credit:
Player (3%)
Shape (0%)
The player will be a rectangle roughly 3 units wide and 1 unit tall
Bullets will be instantiated in the center of the player
Movement (1%)
The player can move left & right
Movement uses the "A", "D", "LeftArrow", and/or "RightArrow" keys
The player should not be able to move up or down
The player cannot move past the left/right edges of the screen
Shooting (1%)
The player can fire projectiles which travel upwards to kill enemies
Shooting uses the "Space" key and/or Left Mouse Button
The player cannot shoot again while a previously fired bullet is still traveling
Death (1%)
The player dies when it collides with an enemy bullet
When the player dies, the player will lose a life
The player has 3 lives
If the player loses its 3rd life, the game is over
Enemies (7%)
Shape (1%)
Each individual enemy will be roughly* 1 unit wide and 1 unit tall
You might make some enemies bigger than others (e.g. lower row enemies are slightly wider)
Enemies form a grid that is 11 enemies wide and 5 enemies tall
Enemies are equally spaced apart
Movement (3%)
All enemies must move in unison, moving left or right
Enemies cannot move past the left/right edges of the screen
Enemy direction changes AND all enemies move down in unison when the furthest enemy on either edge hits a wall
NOTE: If the player eliminates all enemies from the far left or far right column, the next furthest column of live enemies will act as the new collision detector. Essentially, this means that if the player eliminates all enemies in a far left/right column, the entire group of enemies will have to travel a further distance before they hit a wall.
If an enemy reaches the bottom of the screen, the game is over
Shooting (2%)
The enemies can fire projectiles which travel downwards that kill the player
The enemies shoot at random intervals (e.g. an inconsistent fire rate)
When a shot is generated, it will spawn from a randomly chosen column of enemies
The lowest enemy in the randomly chosen column will do the shooting
NOTE: If the player eliminates enemies that were lower in the column, the next lowest enemy of that column will be the new shooter. Essentially, this means the enemy bullet will start higher and higher in that column
Enemy bullets should NOT harm other enemies
Death (1%)
An enemy dies when one of the player's bullets collides with it
When an enemy dies, the player is awarded points:
Bottom 2 rows of enemies: 10 points
Middle 2 rows of enemies: 20 points
Top row of enemies: 40 points
Game Over (4%)
The game is over if the player loses all 3 lives (2%)
The game is over if an enemy reaches the bottom of the screen (2%)

Winning (1%)

For the purposes of the base-requirements, you can treat the player win however you like (e.g. restart the level at 0 points, restart the level while keeping track of the points, display the game over screen, go to the start menu, close the application, display some sort of "YOU WIN!" UI, etc). The only requirement is that something must happen, you cannot leave the player in an empty level with no enemies. More detailed level-end scenarios are covered in the extra-credit.
